## Files:

- `Picture1.png`: A chart created in Excel showing waste generation by city. This image visualizes the data from the dataset and highlights the differences in waste output among various cities.

### How the Image Was Created:
The chart was created using Microsoft Excel by importing the `all_city_waste.csv` file. It visualizes waste generation by city using a bar chart (or other relevant chart type), comparing the total waste output of different cities.

This chart was then saved as a PNG image for inclusion in the repository.
