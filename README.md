# World-Cities-Wastes
This project explores and analyzes global municipal solid waste (MSW) data, with a focus on comparing waste generation and diversion efforts across cities and countries.

## Data Overview

The dataset used comes from the **World Bankâ€™s What a Waste 2.0** global database, which includes information from 300+ cities around the world. It contains data on:

- Total MSW generated (in tons/year)
- Waste treatment methods (e.g. recycling, composting)
- Waste management budgets
- Collection and disposal systems

## Objectives

The key goals of this analysis are:

- Calculate total waste generated by country and identify top contributors
- Identify cities with the **highest** and **lowest diversion rates**
- Highlight top cities by total MSW generated
- Export cleaned and focused subsets of the data for reuse

## ðŸ› Key Steps

1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset
2. Converted relevant columns to numeric
3. Created a new `diversion_rate` metric by combining recycling and composting percentages
4. Grouped and sorted cities and countries based on waste output and diversion
5. Exported subsets to CSV for open access and reuse

## Files

- `city_level_data_0_0.csv` â€“ original dataset
- `all_city_waste.csv` â€“ full list of cities and their total MSW generated


## ðŸ“Ž How to Use

Clone the repo or open the notebook in Google Colab to run the analysis and generate updated CSV files. The code is written in Python using `pandas` and `matplotlib`.
