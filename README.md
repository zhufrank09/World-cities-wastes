# World-Cities-Wastes

About
This repository was created for English 105 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It contains a dataset of global city-level waste management statistics, a processed subset focused on diversion rates, and the Python notebook used to analyze and visualize the data.

The purpose of this project is to examine how waste is generated and managed across different countries and cities, and to highlight the effectiveness of diversion methods like recycling and composting

What's in this repository?
city_level_data_0_0.csv: Raw dataset of global solid waste statistics

diversion_rate_subset.csv: A filtered subset showing diversion rates by city

urban_waste_analysis.ipynb: The Python notebook used to clean, analyze, and visualize the data

README.md: This file

Where is the data from?
The data is sourced from the World Bank Group. It includes city-level information on municipal solid waste (MSW), treatment methods, and environmental indicators. The dataset has been cleaned and reformatted for analysis, but no values were altered.

Why this data?
This dataset helps visualize which cities and countries are generating the most waste and which are doing the best job at diverting it from landfills.
It could be useful to:

Environmental policy analysts

Sustainability researchers

Urban planners and city officials

Curious individuals interested in global waste management trends

Key Findings
Countries with the highest total waste output

Cities with the best and worst diversion rates

Top 10 waste-generating cities globally

How to Use
Open the urban_waste_analysis.ipynb notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook to walk through the full analysis.
To export subsets of the data, the .to_csv() method was used to save new files for reuse and sharing.

What's Next
This project can be expanded by:

Exploring waste treatment types by region

Comparing diversion rates to population or income levels

Mapping diversion performance visually by geography
