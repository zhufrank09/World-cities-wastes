# World-Cities-Wastes
This repository was created for Prof. Gotzler's English 105 class in the Spring 2025 semester at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

It contains the raw data set and the subset of data that was created by manipulating the raw data using Python3.

The repository also includes the Python notebook that documents the process for crafting the subset of data from the original data.

## Data Overview

The dataset used comes from the **World Bankâ€™s What a Waste 2.0** global database, which includes information from 300+ cities around the world. It contains data on:

- Total MSW generated (in tons/year)
- Waste treatment methods (e.g. recycling, composting)
- Waste management budgets
- Collection and disposal systems
