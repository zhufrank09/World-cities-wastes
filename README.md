# World-Cities-Wastes
This repository was created for Prof. Gotzler's English 105 class in the Spring 2025 semester at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

It contains the raw data set and the subset of data that was created by manipulating the raw data using Python3.

The repository also includes the Python notebook that documents the process for crafting the subset of data from the original data.

## Data Overview

The dataset used comes from the **World Bank’s What a Waste 2.0** global database, which includes information from 300+ cities around the world. It contains data on:

- Total MSW generated (in tons/year)
- Waste treatment methods (e.g. recycling, composting)
- Waste management budgets
- Collection and disposal systems

## Objectives

The key goals of this analysis are:

- Calculate total waste generated by country and identify top contributors
- Identify cities with the **highest** and **lowest diversion rates**
- Highlight top cities by total MSW generated
- Export cleaned and focused subsets of the data for reuse

## Key Steps

1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset
2. Converted relevant columns to numeric
3. Created a new `diversion_rate` metric by combining recycling and composting percentages
4. Grouped and sorted cities and countries based on waste output and diversion
5. Exported subsets to CSV for open access and reuse

## Files

- `city_level_data_0_0.csv` – original dataset
- `all_city_waste.csv` – full list of cities and their total MSW generated


## How to Use

Clone the repo or open the notebook in Google Colab to run the analysis and generate updated CSV files. The code is written in Python using `pandas` and `matplotlib`.
