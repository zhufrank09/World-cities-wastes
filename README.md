# Global Urban Waste Management

## About
This repository was created for English 105 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It contains a dataset of global city-level waste management statistics, a processed subset focused on diversion rates, and the Python notebook used to analyze and visualize the data.

The purpose of this project is to examine how waste is generated and managed across different countries and cities, and to highlight the effectiveness of diversion methods like recycling and composting.

## What's in this repository?

```plaintext
📁 data/  
  🔹 city_level_data_0_0 (1).csv – Original raw dataset of global solid waste statistics  
  🔹 all_city_waste.csv – Cleaned and processed dataset  
  🔹 World_cities_wastes.ipynb – Python notebook for cleaning, analyzing, and documenting

📁 images/  
  🔹 Picture1.png – Excel visualization of waste generation by city

📄 README.md – Project overview and usage instructions

## Data Source
The data originates from the **World Bank Group**.  
It includes metrics on municipal solid waste generation, treatment methods, and environmental indicators at the city level.

✅ **Note:**  
The dataset was cleaned and restructured for analysis. No original values were changed.

## Why This Data?
Understanding waste generation and diversion practices helps:
- Environmental policy analysts
- Urban planners and sustainability researchers
- Global citizens curious about waste management challenges

---

## Key Findings
- Cities with the highest total MSW generation
- Best and worst diversion rates globally
- Regional differences in waste management strategies

---

## How to Use This Repository
1. Open the `World_cities_wastes.ipynb` notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
2. Review the data cleaning, analysis, and findings.
3. Check out the Excel visualization below!

## What's Next?
This project could be expanded by:
- Mapping waste diversion rates geographically
- Comparing waste production to population density or GDP
- Exploring trends in recycling, composting, and landfill use worldwide
