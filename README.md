# Global Urban Waste Management

## About
This repository was created for English 105 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  
It explores global patterns in urban waste management by analyzing city-level municipal solid waste (MSW) statistics.

The project includes:
- Raw and cleaned data files
- A Python notebook for analysis and documentation
- A visualization created in Excel

## Data Source
The data originates from the **World Bank Group**.  
It includes metrics on municipal solid waste generation, treatment methods, and environmental indicators at the city level.

✅ **Note:**  
The dataset was cleaned and restructured for analysis. No original values were changed.

## Why This Data?
Understanding waste generation and diversion practices helps:
- Environmental policy analysts
- Urban planners and sustainability researchers
- Global citizens curious about waste management challenges

---

## Key Findings
- Cities with the highest total MSW generation
- Best and worst diversion rates globally
- Regional differences in waste management strategies

---

## How to Use This Repository
1. Open the `World_cities_wastes.ipynb` notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
2. Review the data cleaning, analysis, and findings.
3. Check out the Excel visualization below!

## What's Next?
This project could be expanded by:
- Mapping waste diversion rates geographically
- Comparing waste production to population density or GDP
- Exploring trends in recycling, composting, and landfill use worldwide
